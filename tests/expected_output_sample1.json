        "mechanism": "CYP2D6 encodes a hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme that O-demethylates codeine to morphine (the active analgesic). The *4/*4 diplotype contains rs3892097, a splice-site variant that renders CYP2D6 non-functional. With absent CYP2D6 activity, codeine cannot be bioactivated, resulting in negligible morphine plasma concentrations and inadequate analgesia. CPIC (PMID: 22205192) recommends avoiding codeine in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers.",
