        "summary": "Your DPYD genetics show you cannot break down the chemotherapy drug fluorouracil (5-FU) as fast as most people. This puts you at serious risk of life-threatening side effects including mouth sores, low blood counts, and nerve damage at standard doses. A 50% dose reduction is required before starting treatment.",
        "mechanism": "DPYD encodes dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, the rate-limiting enzyme responsible for catabolizing >80% of administered fluorouracil. The rs3918290 variant (IVS14+1G>A) creates a cryptic splice site, leading to exon 14 skipping and production of a truncated, non-functional DPD enzyme. In *1/*2A heterozygotes, residual DPD activity is ~50% of normal, resulting in markedly elevated 5-FU plasma concentrations and significantly increased risk of grade 3-4 toxicities including mucositis, neutropenia, and neurotoxicity. CPIC recommends 50% dose reduction and phenotyping confirmation.",
